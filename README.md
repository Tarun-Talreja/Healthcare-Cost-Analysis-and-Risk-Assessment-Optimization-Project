# Healthcare Cost Analysis and Risk Assessment Optimization Project

## Overview
This project involved conducting an in-depth healthcare cost analysis using R, with a focus on identifying correlations between various factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, exercise, and hypertension. The project also developed a highly accurate Support Vector Machine (SVM) predictive model to enable precise risk assessment and premium pricing strategies.

## Technologies Used
- R
- SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- Statistical Analysis

## Key Features
- **Healthcare Cost Analysis:** Conducted comprehensive analysis to identify correlations between age, BMI, smoking habits, exercise, and hypertension.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Developed an SVM model with 96% accuracy and 97% sensitivity for risk assessment and premium pricing strategies.
- **Data-Driven Recommendations:** Provided actionable insights for differentiated premium pricing, lifestyle incentives, and personalized health programs.

## Installation/Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository and install the necessary R packages.
2. Run the R scripts to perform the data analysis and train the SVM model.
3. Review the generated reports and visualizations.

## Usage
- Use the SVM model to assess healthcare risks and optimize premium pricing.
- Implement the data-driven recommendations to improve healthcare cost management.

## Results/Outcomes
- **High Accuracy:** Achieved 96% accuracy and 97% sensitivity in predictive modeling.
- **Optimized Decision-Making:** Provided insights that improved decision-making in
